     </h1>

     <p>
        The problem of air pollution is getting very serious, so it is our turn to be<br>
        serious. Here are some things you can do in order to by yourself, at home, in<br>
        order to stop air pollution.<br>
    </p>
        <h3>
            Conserve Energy
        </h3>
        <p>
            Conserving energy is a great way to lower your amount of pollutants and pollution<br>
            released in the air. This helps to reduce air pollution as they are decreasing the<br>
            amount of pollution released on a daily basis. This is one of the most common way to<br>
            conserve energy, and save our environment. Here are some things you can do to conserve<br>
            energy: use less energy at home, office, work, etc, use alternative sources of energy<br>
            that are renewable, and basically use less amount of energy to get the same job done.<br>
        </p>
     <h3>
        Transportation
     </h3>
     <p>
        Using transportation is one important part of our society today, it is the way we get to<br>
        other places quickly, and fastly, but it has a side-effect. Motor powered transportation uses<br>
        fossil fuels that releases pollutants that are a danger to our air and ozone layer. If we<br>
        lessen the use of motor powered vehicles, then we can decrease the amount of pollutants released.<br>
        Here are some ways to use less motor powered vehicles: Carpool (using less cars to get to the<br>
        same place), use public transportation, bicycle to your destination, walk, and stakeboarding.<br>
     </p>
     <h3>
        Recycling and Reusing
     </h3>
     <p>
        Recycling is a great way to reduce air pollution, as it reduces the amount of methane sent to<br>
        the air, and methane is harmful to our atmosphere. Recycling and reusing can also help save<br>
        resources, like paper, cloth, wood, etc. Things you can recycle or reuse include: plastic, paper,<br>
        metal, wood, fabric.<br>
     </p>
     <h3>
        Plantation
     </h3>
     <p>
        Plantation helps us have more trees, which would reduce the amount of CO2 in the air. It would also<br>
        help our world, by giving more oxygen, in addition to making a habitat for animals. Planting a tree<br>
        in open areas helps in plantation. Also, encourage your family, and friends to do the same.
